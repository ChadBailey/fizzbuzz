# FizzBuzz

Watching [this](youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc) YouTube video, I learned that
programming a game of FizzBuzz is a common interview challenge. He challenged
the viewer to pause the video and come up with a solution, so I've done that.

I'm going to try and make this intentionally very much like a real interview
scenario meaning I will not search for answers, over-engineer the solution, or
spend an inordinate amount of time on it.

I'm excluding writing this readme from the time, since I figure writing this
README wouldn't realistically be a part of the interview challenge :P
